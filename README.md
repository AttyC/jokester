# Built with React Native - my first ever React Native app!
Using Expo

## Clone from GitHub
[Link here](https://github.com/AttyC/jokester)


## Install dependencies
`npm install or yarn`

## Issues I faced:

1. I had some issues with images on ios, so in the end I decided to make it work in the browser.
2. This was my first React Native app, so a big learning curve, although I do know React already.
3. Learning how to store in Local Storage and the differences between the local stoage and the API structure. I nearly used a Faunadb database but decidede to forge ahead with the local storage, as it was unfamiliar and specified in the test. I wanted to crack it!


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`


then choose 'w' to run in a web broswer (see 'Issues' above)

Open [http://localhost:91006](http://localhost:91006) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
