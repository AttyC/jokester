# Built with React Native - my first ever React Native app!
This app runs on Expo - following these instructions (Steps 02, 03 and 05):

[https://expo.io/learnhttps://expo.io/learn](https://expo.io/learnhttps://expo.io/learn)


##### Clone from GitHub and install dependencies
```
git clone https://github.com/AttyC/jokester
cd jokester
yarn 
```

## Issues I faced:

1. I had some issues with images and a few other small things on ios, so in the end I decided to make it work in the browser (using Expo web browser).
2. This was my first React Native app, so a big learning curve, although I do know React already.
3. Learning how to store in Local Storage and handling the differences between the data structure in Local Storage (string) and the API (object). I considered using a Faunadb database but decided to forge ahead with the local storage, as it was unfamiliar and specified in the test and I wanted to understand it.


## Start the server

In the project directory, start the server:
```yarn start```

then choose '__w'__ to run in a web browser (you should be able to run it in ios but due to some  issues, this only works in browser. See 'Issues' above)

Open [http://localhost:91006](http://localhost:91006) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
